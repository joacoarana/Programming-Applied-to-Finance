# Programming-Applied-to-Finance

In college I had a subject called "Programming applied to Finance". These were my first steps in the programming world. Thanks to the subject I was able to learn python and apply my knowledge to evaluate financial instruments. 

Disclaimer: I did not write ALL the codes, as some of them were provided by the professor, however, all of them were studied by me. You'll notice it seeing the file's author.
